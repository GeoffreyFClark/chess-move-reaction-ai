# For parse_moves, are we leaving the exceptions as the general type "ValueError" ? Or would it be better to specify specific errors like InvalidMoveError, IllegalMoveError, and AmbiguousMoveError ?
# I plan on implementing mobility feature which evaluates how many legal moves each side has.
# Center control.
# Extend the king safety heuristic by including whether the king's escape squares shrink.
# Roughly check for doubled, isolated, and passed pawns.

# ------------ Comments from review ------------ #

# Thanks, your plans regarding feature extraction sound good to add! Other quick ideas: 
# - measure pinned piece count - board.is_pinned() 
# - Castling-rights lost flags - board.has_castling_rights() 
# - King-ring pressure (attackers on the 8 surrounding squares i.e. defending pawns) - board.attackers()
# - Check flags (is the side to move in check or giving check after a move)
# - Identifying when pieces are placed on undefended squares
# - Piece development i.e. 4v2 developed out of the opening)
# - legal_moves / generate_legal_moves() could be useful in many ways... including iteration through future board states for deeper feature extraction.

# InvalidMoveError, IllegalMoveError, AmbiguousMoveError in python-chess all subclass ValueError, so one except ValueError already catches them. I kept it simple, but if we ever want to distinguish the types, we can just add type(e).__name__ to the message. Honestly, more useful might be richer debug/error messages and additional tests to support both extraction logic and the reaction/explanation logic.

# Aside from expanding feature extraction, our main focus should be on utilizing those features in patterns/heuristics/algorithms from our course so the “AI reactions” feel more meaningful. Let's talk more on Discord with the rest of the team to delegate tasks more clearly.
