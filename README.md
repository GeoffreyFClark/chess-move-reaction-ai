# Chess Move Reaction AI
Chess engines give raw scores and best lines, but not explanations, reasons, or reactions. Many chess players would appreciate AI that feels like a coach or informed spectator: it evaluates a move and reacts with both logic and tone (“Great fork! This move wins material.” or “Prudent choice to move your king to a safer square.” or “Careful. That move hangs a piece.”). Beyond the scope of this project, the concept could be expanded into customized spectator/companion bots, i.e. famous players or commentators.
